# Challenge #2 - Performance Problems
This challenge is in the `challenge-2/` directory.

## Challenge 2 Details
There's something wrong with the code in this project. Instead of taking ~3.1s to complete it's taking much longer to return.  
You have two goals for this challenge:
1. Determine the problem and explain why the code is taking so much longer to return than expected. Please add your explanation to this README below.
2. Fix it. Make the code run as quickly and efficiently as you can.
